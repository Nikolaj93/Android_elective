Week 8. Expand on your app "MyNotebook" from previous week. 
Now the first page should be a list of headlines. 
Add a + button in the top right corner. When pressed, a new headline should be added to the list. 
When a headline is pressed, the user should be led to a detail Activity, where the entire content is visible. And editable. Any edit should be saved in memory, when the user goes back to the list of headlines.
