Week 12. exercise for this week.
Resize image. Figure out how to reduce the size of the image, that you get from the camera. 
save the image from 1) to photo roll. (OK to use deprecated method, as of API 29)
(this is supposed to be a short exercise, in lines of code at least).
It IS ok, if you manage to save the photo to the device's local filesystem.
